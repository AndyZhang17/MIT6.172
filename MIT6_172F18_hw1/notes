Preprocessing:
  The C preprocessor modifies source code before it is passed to the compilation phase. 
  * string substitution of #define macros
  * conditionally omits sections of code
  * processes #include directives to import entire files' worth of code
  * strips comments from code

Primitive types: 
  You can define more complex data types by composing primitive types into a struct.
  i.e.:
    typedef struct {
      long id;
      unsigned short year;
    } student;
    student you;
    you.id. = 12345
    you.year = 5
